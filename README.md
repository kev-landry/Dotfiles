# Personal setup dotfiles

### Purpose

In order to sync my env accross multiple computers or when i format one.

Everything is in one directory called Dotfiles in ~/. The idea is to bring together multiple dot files scatered around .config or ~/.
For this i use *stow* to symlink into Dotfiles directory.

- My OS is ubuntu 22
- Wezterm is the terminal used (written is Rust)
- Hyperjs is the terminal i used until some time ago
- Zeillij is the multiplexer (love its layout/tab/pane management)
- Gitui as a terminal git ui layout (written ins Rust)
- Phpstorm as ide 
- Neovim might be my main code editor soon to be a 10x developper ^_^

I might write a tuto to setup all of this apps in the future
